Memory component comparison

Component	Range	DMA	Physical	Block	Overhead	Notes
---------	-----	---	--------	-----	--------	-----
BlockRAM	31 bits	Yes	0-2 Gb		1-2 Gb	4 bytes/block	Allocates in blocks, as needed
CEFMemory	64 bits	Yes	Varies		256	20%
S64K_RAM	16 bits	Yes	64 Kb		64 Kb	None		Fixed size
S4M_RAM		20 bits	Yes	4 Mb		4 Mb	None		Fixed size
SRAM		31 bits	Yes*	0-2 Gb		Varies	None		Expands to meet address written
SVM_Code_RAM	64 bits	No	0		0	None		RAM is mapped to disk file(s)

* Writing to the component can change the physical position of the data.

Range is the address range supported by the component.
DMA indicates if the internal storage of the component is directly accessible from
outside the component.  Note that direct access cannot span blocks.
Physical is the amount of physical memory required by the component, not counting
overhead.
Block indicates the size of the internal blocks allocated by the component.
Overhead indicates the amount of overhead associated with the emulated memory.  Note
that all components require fixed overhead in addition to the overhead for the
emulated memory.
